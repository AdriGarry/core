## Framework

### API

- CoreError
- CronJobList
- Flux
- Logger
- Observers
- Utils

### Core engine

- Core
- Lock

#### Core.conf

The Core.conf holds cycle informations: _mode, alarms, version_...

This object is isolated, with access methods.

This object is file persisted and has a default version to reset.

#### Core.run

The Core.run holds runtime informations: _etat, volume, max, mood, music, alarms, timer, voicemail, cpu, memory, stats_.

This object is isolated, with access methods.

#### Flux manager

A flux manager, based on RxJS, can send or schedule (delay, repeat) orders.
The _Core.do() (Flux.next())_ function accepts flux object (full or detailled), or list of fluxs.

A flux is an Object with 3 properties:

- id: _type|subject|name_

- [data]: any type

- [conf]: `{delay, loop, log}`

  - [delay]: _number_ delay to fire flux in seconds

  - [loop]: _number_ times to loop flux

  - [log]: _string_ log level where the flux will be logged
